# Shakespeare Text Analysis: NLP Key Phrase Extraction

Natural Language Processing project analyzing Shakespeare's Macbeth using tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and n-gram analysis to extract meaningful key phrases and linguistic patterns.

## Project Overview

Applied fundamental NLP techniques to extract and analyze key phrases from Shakespeare's Macbeth. The analysis identified 4,076 unique tokens and revealed linguistic patterns related to power, hierarchy, and character agency through statistical frequency analysis.

## Key Results

**Top Bigrams:**
- "i haue" (41) - "my lord" (22) - "'t is" (36)

**Top Trigrams:**
- "thane of cawdor" (13) - "knock knock knock" (6) - "my good lord" (8)

**Insights:**
- Frequent titles ("my lord", "thane of cawdor") reflect themes of power and hierarchy
- High frequency of "i haue" and "i am" shows character agency and introspection
- Statistical analysis identified the famous porter scene through "knock knock knock" repetition

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.12.8
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install nltk
jupyter notebook ShakespeareTextAnalysis.ipynb
