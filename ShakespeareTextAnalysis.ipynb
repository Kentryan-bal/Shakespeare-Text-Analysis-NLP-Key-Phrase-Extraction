    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project demonstrates fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques applied to classic literature from Shakespeare's plays. The analysis pipeline includes tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and statistical key phrase extraction using n-gram analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Extract and analyze text from Shakespeare's plays using the NLTK Gutenberg corpus\n",
    "- Implement tokenization to break down text into processable units\n",
    "- Apply stemming and lemmatization for text normalization\n",
    "- Extract meaningful key phrases using n-gram frequency analysis (monograms, bigrams, and trigrams)\n",
    "- Identify and contextualize significant phrases within the original text\n",

    "- \"'t is\" (36 occurrences) - Common Shakespearean contraction\n",
    "- \"my lord\" (22 occurrences) - Formal address reflecting the play's focus on nobility and hierarchy\n",

    "3. **Dramatic Tension**: The repetition of \"knock knock knock\" captures a key atmospheric moment in the play\n",

    "## Conclusion: What I Learned About Analyzing Macbeth\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights About Macbeth's Linguistic Landscape\n",
    "Through this NLP analysis of Shakespeare's Macbeth, I discovered several fascinating patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The Language of Power and Hierarchy**\n",
    "The play's vocabulary is dominated by formal titles and addresses. The phrase \"my lord\" appears 22 times, and \"thane of cawdor\" - central to Macbeth's fatal ambition - appears 13 times. This quantitative evidence confirms that Macbeth is fundamentally a play about power, ambition, and social rank. The frequent use of formal address reflects the rigid hierarchical structure of medieval Scottish society.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Character Voice and Agency**\n",
    "The high frequency of \"i haue\" (41 times) and \"i am\" (29 times) reveals that Macbeth features characters who assert their agency and actions. This is fitting for a tragedy driven by personal choice and moral corruption - characters constantly declare what they have done or who they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Dramatic Moments Captured Statistically**\n",
    "The trigram \"knock knock knock\" appearing 6 times might seem insignificant, but it represents one of the play's most famous scenes - the porter's scene after Duncan's murder. This shows how NLP can identify dramatically significant moments through repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Lexical Richness**\n",
    "With 4,076 unique tokens, Macbeth demonstrates Shakespeare's linguistic complexity. The vocabulary includes archaic spellings (haue, 't is) that preserve the historical authenticity of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Insights Gained\n",
    "- **Lemmatization vs. Raw Text**: By lemmatizing tokens, I was able to group related word forms and identify true thematic patterns rather than just counting spelling variations\n",
    "- **N-gram Effectiveness**: Bigrams and trigrams proved more meaningful than monograms for understanding content - while monograms were mostly function words (\"the\", \"and\"), bigrams captured actual phrases like \"my lord\"\n",
    "- **Context Validation**: Locating key phrases in the original text confirmed that frequency-based extraction does identify genuinely important elements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skills Demonstrated\n",
    "This project showcases my ability to:\n",
    "- Apply NLP preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization) to literary texts\n",
    "- Extract and interpret statistical patterns from unstructured text data\n",
